          Hi. My name is Douglas, and I&apos;m a software developer. Nice to
          meet you ðŸ‘‹. Aside from software development, I also like to play some
          games and write about things I learn.

          One day, I went to visit a technical school. I saw some robots and
          decided to learn programming, and here I am ðŸ˜€. I&apos;ve been
          studying software development for over 4 years now.

          While working professionally, I managed to ship products which
          generated value and eased the life of thousands of users whilst
          improving the quality of existing software and creating new, valuable
          software from the beginning.
